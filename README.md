Characters

The main character of this game is Napoleon, almost a 1 to 1 on this historical figure, but you assume the role of Napoleon, so it influences the choices you are able to make. Napoleon is a French military leader and emperor. He was short, ambitious, and a strong leader. 

Louis-Alexandre Berthier is a French military commander and second hand man of Napoleon, he acts as a voice prompting Napoleon to make decisions in the game. He is organised, meticulous and relentlessly loyal which is reflected in his dialogue. 

 Story
Initially, the story was Napoleon, being the workaholic he is, decides to take some free leisure time off in order to clear his mind in preparation for the battle of Waterloo. The story then pans to his second in command (Louis), who has seen that Napoleon misplaced his watch and Charleville M1777 musket. The player would have then had to make decisions based on their knowledge of Napoleon as well as clues provided in-game in order to find Napoleon and provide him with these items before he misses the battle. The Story was later changed to be Napoleon needing to optimize the last bit of free time he has left in order to have sufficient combat power and charisma, and leader level for the battle of Waterloo, the endings vary from what the values of each of these are.
Theme
This game plays with the idea of having a good work-life balance and spending your time wisely. There’s also a strong military theme overseeing the whole game and whilst not being a comedy in genre there are little hints of comedy in the games choices as well, other than this it’s a relatively serious fictional story based on real life events.



Story Progression
The Game starts with Napoleon’s second in command asking what he would like to do, then the player is given an array of choices with multiple different outcomes and multiple different effects on his stats. The story progresses within real life time, in the event the player doesn’t end the time within 5 minutes then it result in a guaranteed bad end, there is an ending where the player has sufficient Charisma but insufficient Combat power, the inverse of this and finally an ending where the player meets all requirements which will be the true ending for this story.
Gameplay
The goal of this game is to make the right decisions within the given time frame to maximise both Combat power and Charisma.

Skills that the user will utilize playing include critical thinking, thinking under pressure, memory, puzzle solving, management of resources, strategy, time management, and logical reasoning.

The game mechanics include scores and levels, which act as a trackable, readable metric for the player to understand how they are impacting the game and its story. Point and click as the method of how different things in the game are done. Dialogue systems, where players choose from a set of action/dialogue options to influence the game. Player choice and consequences, and statistics at the end of the story, where the player’s choices impact the story, and this is portrayed.

The challenge comes from managing how different options influence your stats differently and keeping both values up whilst under pressure as a result of time constraints, the having to manage time yourself and not having it being done automatically for you adds another layer to the challenge since you always have to be thinking about the time you’re spending whilst thinking about other things and making choices constantly. The progression is dynamic as it’s up to you. And depending on when you choose to progress, or in this case, finish it, can affect the outcome of the story.

Whilst there is no direct way to lose, losing could be interpreted as getting a bad ending, and the conditions for losing is not having enough Charisma, not enough Combat power, or not finishing up before the time allocated runs out.

The artstyle should be french themed in colour scheme as it’s about a French historical figure and feature many military like imagery throughout it all, perhaps a classical or stylised artstyle accompanying the menus and interfaces. 

The music and sound effects aim to primarily make clicking through each option satisfying and making it clear with sound design what you’re doing when clicking each button. The background music also reflects how much time is left, helps add tension, and improves clarity for the player. Ideally, the music would be on theme for the semi-serious war-like theme the game presents. Different sound effects for options giving you more combat power or more charisma could be added to help with clarity, also.
